# Jar Mania

This is a public version of this final project for storage purposes. I do not claim ownership for any of the assets and the like, just the code.

This was just made to work with 2D graphics in Java and learn some aspects of game development. I was playing Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds just around this time so much of the visual concept was inspired by the series.
